This application is simply a test app that was created for the interview process of a company I applied to a while ago. As such, it is exceptionally simple and focused entirely on providing the base functionality requested.

The functionality requested for this app was a simple, command line way to generate a "Rental Agreement" for a tool. The app as it stands now should only be taken as an example of my coding style and code organization.
